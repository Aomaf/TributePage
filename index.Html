                <p>After suffering depression and surviving a car accident at the age of 19, Brendon faced what he felt were life’s last questions: “Did I live fully? Did I love openly? Did I make a difference?” His intention to be happy with the answers led to his own personal breakthroughs, and ultimately to his life’s purpose of helping others live, love and matter. He spent his 20s researching psychology and leadership, and consulting at Accenture. By age 32, he had struck out on his own and became a #1 best-selling author, an in-demand high performance coach, a sought-after speaker, and an early pioneer in the online education space.

                    Today, Brendon is widely considered the world’s leading high performance coach (according to both Success Magazine and Oprah.com). He is also one of the most-watched, quoted and followed personal development trainers in history. He is a Top 100 Most Followed Public Figure on Facebook and his videos have been viewed more than 100 million times. More than 2,000,000 students have completed his online courses and video series. For these results, Oprah.com named him “one of the most successful online trainers in history.”

His latest book, High Performance Habits: How Extraordinary People Become That Way, debuted as a Wall Street Journal Bestseller and Amazon named it in the Top 3 Best Business and Leadership Books of 2017.

                    Brendon is also the star and executive producer of the #1 self-help series on YouTube. His podcast, The Charged Life (now The Brendon Show), debuted at #1 on iTunes across all categories in multiple countries, and remained in the Top 10 in its category for over 100 weeks. His live webcasts continue to set records and have generated tens of millions of dollars in sales.</p>
